# Markdown Syntax Training
Markdown is a cool thing. I used it a lot during my time in HTL Kaindorf. I used different tools to edit and view Markdown files. I liked the tool [Typora](https://typora.io/) a lot, but sticked to VSC to write Markdown and used Typora to convert it to PDFs. 

## Typora

I liked the focus design. It reminded me of Notion, now that I think about it. The dark mode was an amazing feature.

You could edit and view Markdowns in Dark Mode. You had assiting tools while Editing and you could I think edit in the Preview directly.

## Notion
Notion can also use Markdown. I am still trying to use it but can't wrap my head around all the functions still.

## Cheatsheet for Markdown

This is my favorite Markdown Cheatsheet.
